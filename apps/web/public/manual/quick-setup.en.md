## 0. Before You Start

**Terms**

| Term | Meaning |
|---|---|
| Tenant | One store hosted on ShopTalk. Data, settings, and knowledge are fully isolated per store |
| Slug | The tenant's dedicated login URL fragment. Appended to the address like `https://shoptalk.amoeba.site/ivyusa` |
| Platform administrator | A ShopTalk operator admin who logs in at `/admin` (has tenant-creation rights) |
| Tenant administrator (master) | The highest rank in the store console. Manages all team members, permissions, and settings |
| Temporary password | A one-time password issued by the system at invite time. **Shown on screen only once** |

**What you need**
- A platform administrator account (`/admin/login`)
- The **shop domain** of the store to create (e.g. `example.myshopify.com`, `mallid.cafe24.com`)
- The **email address** of the person to invite as tenant administrator
- Credentials for the platform to integrate (see Chapter 3 — prepared by the tenant administrator)

**Time required**: ~5 min of admin work + ~30 min of initial tenant setup (excluding platform integration approval wait)

---

## 1. Creating a Tenant
*(Platform administrator · `/admin/tenants`)*

### 1.1 Create a new tenant

`/admin/tenants` → **[New tenant]** button → fill 4 fields in the modal:

| Field | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|
| Name | ✅ | Display name of the store |
| Login path (slug) | — | Auto-derived from the name if left blank. Lowercased automatically when typed |
| Shop domain | ✅ | The store's primary domain. `*.myshopify.com` for Shopify, the mall domain for Cafe24, etc. — **shared across all platforms** |
| Plan | ✅ | `starter` / `growth` / `enterprise` — the default menus provided differ by plan |

💡 **Tip — slug rules**: lowercase letters, digits, and hyphens only; it cannot collide with
console screen names (reserved words such as `admin`, `login`, `dashboard`, `settings`). If you
enter a reserved word, the server automatically appends a `-shop` suffix. Since the slug is
the login URL itself, choose a value the store can remember easily.

### 1.2 (Optional) Adjust provided menus

On the tenant row, **[Provided menus]** → three-way choice per menu:

| Mode | Meaning |
|---|---|
| Follow plan | Keep the plan default (default) |
| Force provide | Provide to this tenant regardless of plan |
| Block | Withhold regardless of plan |

The result column updates immediately, and rows with an exception show a `*`.

💡 **Tip**: A menu blocked here stays invisible even if the tenant master grants rank
permissions for it (2-tier structure: admin provisioning → tenant-internal permissions).
The issue board also requires the workflow mode to be configured.

### 1.3 Invite the tenant administrator + issue a temporary password

On the tenant row, **[Users]** → `/admin/tenants/…/users` → **[Invite user]**:

1. Enter the `email`; keep `rank` at the default **master** (this is the first administrator)
2. Click **[Invite]** → a **temporary password modal** appears immediately

```
┌─ Temporary password issued ──────────────────┐
│ Temporary password for user@shop.com          │
│ ┌──────────────────────────┐                 │
│ │  IvyXXXXXXXXX!           │   [Copy]        │
│ └──────────────────────────┘                 │
│ ⚠️ This value is shown only once, right now.  │
│    Deliver it through a secure channel;       │
│    it must be changed at first login.         │
└──────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

> ⚠️ **The temporary password is NOT sent by email.** The administrator must copy the value
> shown once in this modal and **deliver it directly**. If you closed the window and lost the
> value, reissue it with the **[Temp password]** button on that user's row (the previous
> value is invalidated).

💡 **Tip — secure delivery**: Never leave the password in an email body or a group chat.
Deliver it via a 1:1 secure messenger or a phone call, and consider the creation procedure
complete only after confirming the first login (= forced change) has happened. Every
issuance is recorded in the audit log (`/admin/audit`).

### 1.4 Hand over the login URL

The card at the top of the same screen shows this tenant's **login page URL**
(`https://…/slug`). **[Copy]** it and hand it over together with the temporary password.

Three things to deliver: ① login URL ② email (account ID) ③ temporary password

---

## 2. First Login
*(Tenant administrator · `https://shoptalk.amoeba.site/<slug>`)*

### 2.1 Log in

Opening the URL you received shows a login screen bearing the store name. Sign in with the
email + temporary password.

💡 **Tip**: If you see "store not found", check the spelling of the slug in the URL.
Turn on **Remember email** and this browser will pre-fill the email next time.

### 2.2 Forced password change

Immediately after login, a **non-dismissable password change dialog** appears (it cannot be
cancelled — the console cannot be used with a temporary password).

- Enter `current (temporary) password` + `new password` + `confirmation`
- The three new-password rules are shown as live ✓/✕ while you type:
  **① at least 10 characters ② at least 3 of: uppercase, lowercase, digits, special characters ③ not a common password**
- Passwords containing your own email, or identical to the previous one, are rejected by the server

### 2.3 MFA (two-factor authentication) enrollment

The master and director ranks are **required to enroll MFA (TOTP)** by security policy.

| Term | Meaning |
|---|---|
| TOTP | The 6-digit code that an authenticator app (Google Authenticator, etc.) generates every 30 seconds |
| Recovery codes | 10 one-time codes to use if you lose the authenticator app — **shown only once, right after enrollment** |

- Before the enforcement date: a yellow grace banner at the top (showing the deadline) → you can enroll early from My Page
- After the enforcement date: an enrollment dialog blocks console use until you enroll
- Enrollment: scan the QR (or enter the manual key) → type the app's 6-digit code →
  **download/store the 10 recovery codes** → done. From then on, every login asks for the
  6-digit code as an extra step

💡 **Tip**: The recovery codes are shown only this once. Be sure to save them. If you lose
both the authenticator app and the recovery codes, only an administrator's (system admin or
store master) **[Reset MFA]** can unlock you.

---

## 3. Commerce Platform Integration
*(Console left menu **[Settings]** → store integration cards)*

In the store integration tiles on the Settings page, press **[Configure]** on the platform
you use to open the integration dialog. After saving credentials, always verify with
**[Test connection]**.

| Term | Meaning |
|---|---|
| Credential | Keys/tokens for accessing the platform API. Stored encrypted; after saving, only "Configured" is shown instead of the value |
| Test connection | A button that makes one real API call with the saved credentials to verify their validity |
| Sync | The job that pulls the platform's order/product data into the ShopTalk cache |

### 3.1 Cafe24 ✅

**Recommended path — OAuth connection card**: on the *Cafe24 connection* card of the Settings page
1. Enter the `mall ID` (the mallID part of `mallID.cafe24.com`)
2. **[Connect]** → you are taken to the Cafe24 authorization page → sign in and approve → automatically returned to the console
3. Confirm the Connected badge, then run **[Sync now]** (orders) / **[Import products]**

💡 **Tip**: Product sync fills only the product **cache**. For the AI to use these products
in answers, you must separately run **Sync from catalog** (preview → run) on the [Knowledge]
screen — see [Knowledge & AI Manual, Chapter 2.2](knowledge-ai.en.md).

Manual path (if you already hold a token): you can also enter `mall_id` +
`access_token` (+ client_id/secret) directly in the cafe24 modal of the store integration
tile. The OAuth connection is the standard.

### 3.2 Shopify ✅

Shopify modal in the store integration tile:

| Field | Required |
|---|---|
| Shop domain (`*.myshopify.com`) | ✅ |
| Admin API Access Token | ✅ |
| API Key / API Secret | Optional |

After saving, run **[Test connection] → [Sync now] → [Register webhooks]** in that order.
Webhooks must be registered for order/shipping status changes to reach widget notifications
in real time. For token issuance steps, see the Shopify integration guide.

### 3.3 Odoo ✅ (credentials·connection test) 🟡 (real-time sync)

In the odoo tile modal, enter `server URL` / `DB name` / `username` / `API Key` and test
the connection. Real-time data sync is in preparation.

### 3.4 Storefront URL

Enter the store's **customer-facing site address** in the *Storefront* card. If unset, the
widget's product links are disabled (the card shows a warning).

> Other integrations — WooCommerce·Haravan (commerce), Klaviyo·Yotpo (marketing),
> Gorgias (helpdesk), messenger channels (Telegram·Gmail, etc.) — connect through the same
> kind of tiles/cards. They are omitted from this document.

---

## 4. Chat Widget Setup & Installation
*(the widget cards on the **[Settings]** page)*

### 4.1 Install the widget

In the **installation guide card**, pick the platform tab (Shopify / Cafe24 / WooCommerce /
Odoo) to see the installation snippet and step-by-step guide for that platform. Every code
block has a copy button.

- **Shopify**: three method tabs — app embed (recommended) / ScriptTag / manual install
- **Cafe24**: a dedicated snippet to paste into the mall design (it includes the member login path)
- **WooCommerce**: a PHP snippet for `functions.php` / **Odoo**: a generic HTML snippet

In the **Embed & SDK card**:
- Copy the universal installation snippet (`embed.js`)
- **Allowed domains**: the list of domains where the widget may load. If left blank, the storefront URL applies
- **Signing secret**: used for member identity federation (login federation). **After [Generate],
  the value is shown only once** — copy it immediately and hand it to your server engineer

💡 **Tip**: The surest verification is to open the live shop page and check that the
launcher (speech-bubble button) appears at the bottom right. If it does not, see
[Chapter 9, Troubleshooting](#9-troubleshooting).

### 4.2 Copy & behavior (widget behavior card)

| Item | Description |
|---|---|
| Login method | `redirect` (go to the shop login page and return, default) / `popup` (popup login) |
| Timezone | The store's timezone — used for business-hours display, etc. |
| Display name | The store name shown in the widget header (max 80 characters) |
| First-visit greeting / post-login greeting | Written per language tab (EN/ES/KO) (max 500 characters) |

💡 **Tip**: If a greeting is left empty for a language, the default copy is used. It is fine
to write one primary language carefully first and fill in the rest later.

### 4.3 Tabs & theme

**Widget tabs card**: choose which of the 3 tabs — notifications / orders / chat — to show
(at least 1 must remain — the last one cannot be unchecked); tab position is top/bottom.

**Widget theme card**: `brand color` (picker/HEX) · `header style` (white/brand color) ·
`logo` upload · `launcher` position (left/right)·size (sm/md/lg)·icon (chat/question
mark/headset/logo). The preview on the right updates instantly.

💡 **Tip**: You only need to pick **one brand color**. Lightness steps and text colors are
computed automatically against the contrast standard (4.5:1), so "I picked a light color and
the text disappeared" cannot happen. A saved theme takes effect **from the customer's next
widget session**. Details: widget settings guide.

---

## 5. Minimum AI Configuration
*(left menu **[AI settings]**)*

The AI settings screen has settings cards on the left and the **preview/coaching studio** on
the right. At the setup stage, only three things need checking.

| Term | Meaning |
|---|---|
| Persona | Text describing the AI assistant's tone, attitude, and principles. Sets the tone of every AI answer |
| Response rules | The list of rules the AI must obey (one line = one rule) |
| Engine | The AI model that generates answers. Choose among those registered by the platform administrator |
| stub | A demo responder that works without a real AI key. **Not production quality** |

1. Describe the store introduction, tone, and prohibitions in the **bot persona** card and save
   (e.g. *"You are the friendly, concise assistant of OO Mall. Answer only from the provided knowledge."*)
2. Register at least 2–3 **response rules**
   (e.g. "Never state that a refund is complete", "Never guarantee arrival on a specific date")
3. In the **AI functions** card, check the engine applied to each function — **a `stub` badge
   means no real engine is connected**. Ask the platform administrator to register engines
   (`/admin/ai-engines`).

💡 **Tip**: The scenario buttons (the quick menu at the bottom of the widget) come with 6
defaults (track shipping · cancel/refund · product help · contact support · partnership ·
my orders) applied automatically, so you do not need to touch them at the setup stage.
For persona/rule writing tips and full AI configuration, see
[Knowledge & AI Manual, Chapter 4](knowledge-ai.en.md).

---

## 6. Initial Knowledge Entry
*(left menu **[Knowledge]**)*

The AI answers **only from registered knowledge**. Without knowledge, most questions get
handed to agents, so register the 3–5 core policy documents at the setup stage.

1. In the documents card, **[Add document]** → enter `title` / `category` (autocomplete) /
   `content` → save
   - Recommended first documents: **shipping policy · cancellation/refund policy ·
     exchange/return procedure · frequently asked questions**
   - On save, the document is embedded (search-indexed) automatically
2. In the **knowledge QA panel** on the right, type questions a customer would ask and check
   the answer, sources, and confidence
   - If the document you just registered appears in the source list, you succeeded

💡 **Tip**: Including **the phrasing customers actually use** (e.g. "how long does shipping
take") in the document title and body raises search hit rates. Bulk product knowledge
(catalog sync·CSV), external sources (Google Drive·Notion), and validation/quality
management are covered in the [Knowledge & AI Manual](knowledge-ai.en.md).

---

## 7. (Optional) Team Invites & Handoff Settings

- **Invite team members**: **[Users]** menu → [Invite user] → choose email, rank
  (director/manager/staff), and duty labels → the same **temporary password modal** as in
  Chapter 1 appears (shown once · deliver directly). Per-menu access is adjusted per rank in
  the *Menu access* card of [Settings] (master only).
- **Handoff settings**: in the *Agent handoff* section of [Settings], assign the responsible
  agents, business hours, and the off-hours intake email. Details:
  [Knowledge & AI Manual, Chapter 5](knowledge-ai.en.md).

---

## 8. Completion Checklist

- [ ] Tenant created + administrator invited · temp password delivered (admin)
- [ ] First login → password changed → MFA enrolled
- [ ] Platform integration: credentials saved + **connection test passed** + (Shopify) webhooks registered
- [ ] Storefront URL configured
- [ ] Widget snippet installed → **launcher confirmed visible on the live shop**
- [ ] Display name & greetings written
- [ ] Persona & response rules saved; AI engine confirmed not `stub`
- [ ] 3+ core policy documents registered → answers verified in the QA panel
- [ ] Asked a question directly in the widget and confirmed AI answer + sources (end-to-end)

---

## 9. Troubleshooting

**Q. I cannot log in (temporary password).**
Reissuing a temporary password invalidates the previous value. Make sure you have the latest
issuance; if it still fails, ask the administrator to reissue. Also check that the slug in
the login URL is not another store's (after 2+ failures, guidance appears on screen).

**Q. I closed the temporary password window.**
The value cannot be viewed again. Reissue it with the **[Temp password]** button on the
user's row.

**Q. The widget does not appear on the shop.**
Check, in order: ① the snippet is on the actually deployed page ② the domain is included in
the allowed domains of the embed card (if empty, the storefront URL applies) ③ refresh the
browser cache.

**Q. AI answers feel oddly mechanical.**
Check whether the AI functions card shows a `stub` badge. The stub is a demo responder. Ask
the platform administrator to register a real engine.

**Q. The AI keeps handing off to "connect to an agent".**
Most likely there is no knowledge document on that topic, or it is inactive. Register
documents as in Chapter 6 and verify with the QA panel.

**Q. I changed settings but the widget looks the same.**
Widget settings (copy·theme·tabs) take effect from the customer's **next session**. Close
and reopen the widget, or refresh the page.
